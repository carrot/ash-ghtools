Usage:

    github:labels [$label-config|list]
        Bulk creates labels in a Github repository from a label-config file.
        You will be prompted for a Github repository to apply the labels.

        Label config files are located the /extras/label_configs directory,
        and are formatted with one label per line, with the label name on
        the left,  separated by a colon (:) and the color hex value on the
        right.

        You will need to set GITHUB_TOKEN in your .ashrc file that is a
        valid Github access token with permissions that are enough to
        create labels in the repo you use.
